.SYNOPSIS
    Authenticode-sign one file, if a certificate is configured.

.DESCRIPTION
    Called by Tauri for every binary it bundles (bundle.windows.signCommand),
    with the file to sign as the only argument.

    NO-OPS WHEN NO CERTIFICATE IS CONFIGURED, and says so. That is deliberate:
    an unsigned build is the normal state for a developer, and a build that
    fails because a colleague has no certificate helps nobody. The install still
    works; Windows just shows SmartScreen.

    The certificate is never in this repo. It is read from the environment:

        EDITOR_SIGN_THUMBPRINT  SHA-1 thumbprint of a cert in the Windows store
        PDCG_SIGN_THUMBPRINT      accepted too, so ONE variable signs every
                                  PDC-Demo suite build on this machine
        EDITOR_SIGN_TIMESTAMP / PDCG_SIGN_TIMESTAMP
                                  RFC-3161 timestamp URL (optional, has a default)

    A thumbprint identifies a certificate the machine already trusts; it is not
    a secret and carries no key material, so it is safe in CI variables. The
    private key stays in the certificate store, or on the HSM/token backing it -
    which is what the code-signing rules have required since June 2023, and why
    a .pfx file is not offered here.

.EXAMPLE
    $env:PDCG_SIGN_THUMBPRINT = "A1B2C3..."
    npm run tauri:build
