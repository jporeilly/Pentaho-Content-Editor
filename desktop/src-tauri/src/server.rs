// Lifecycle of the bundled Python backend.
//
// The app is a FastAPI server serving a React SPA, so the desktop build has to
// run a real HTTP server and point a webview at it. Three things make that
// safe enough to hand to a customer laptop:
//
//   1. A FREE PORT, chosen at launch. 5001 is the app's usual port and a
//      second instance (or anything else on the machine) must not turn into
//      "the app won't start".
//   2. A JOB OBJECT on Windows, so the server dies when we do - INCLUDING when
//      we are killed from Task Manager or crash. A leaked uvicorn keeps its
//      port and its lock on the state files, and the next launch then fails
//      for a reason the user cannot see.
//   3. NO STATE UNDER THE INSTALL. The editor writes into the Content
//      Manager checkout it is pointed at, and its own two files - settings
//      and the publish cache - resolve to %APPDATA% when api/ is not
//      writable (api/paths.py). The install tree is read-only in practice,
//      which is what lets the uninstaller remove it completely.
